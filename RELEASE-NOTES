0.1     Oct 29, 2022
    Initial version

0.2     June 7, 2023
    - fixed message:
        "Found 1 messages with an invalid date out of total messages"
      to include intended total message count.
    - slight formating change to usage (--help) message for -c/--config

0.3     July 15, 2023
    - spam-summary.plx:
        - can now decode subjects using UTF-8 encoding, so we no longer
          get subjects printed like:
            =?UTF-8?B?8J+SpUFUVEVOVElPTvCfkqUgM08uT09PIHdvcmx...
    - README.md, spam-summary.1:
        - removed example showing a subject of '=?utf-8?B?UGF5ZXogdm90c...'
          since we can now decode that UTF

0.4     Dec 28, 2024
    - spam-summary.plx:
        - fixed error with incorrect dates by including more error checking.
          It would crap out with messages like:
            Second '+0100' out of range 0..59 at /home/rj/bin/spam-summary ...
          when it encountered dates like:
            "7 Dec 10:03:04 +0100 ..."
          instead of dates like:
            "7 Dec 2024 10:03:04 +0100 ...", 
          and it interpreted +0100 incorrectly because of the missing year
    - README.UTF8-handling:
        - added
